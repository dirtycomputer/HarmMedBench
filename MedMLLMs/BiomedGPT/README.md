# BiomedGPT
[BiomedGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17100) is developed based on [OFA](https://github.com/OFA-Sys/OFA) but pre-trained and fine-tuned with multi-modal & multi-task biomedical datasets. Details are shown in [datasets.md](datasets.md). If you have any questions, feel free to contact us or post issues. 

Breaking News! ðŸ’¥ :

We have updated the fine-tuning receipts to to match or surpass the performance of prior state-of-the-art models, including Med-PaLM M (12B) and GPT-4V. For more details, please refer to the corresponding preprint version was updated. Below is a snapshot comparing these performances.

- [] We're updating our codebase and will soon release the latest SOTA checkpoints for various downstream tasks.
- [] Efforts are underway to translate our code **from fairseq to Hugging Face**, simplifying usage for users.
- [x] We used instruction following data (10k) from LLaVA-Med to tune our pre-trained checkpoints, and showed much better zero-shot performance on the VQA-RAD test set.

# Checkpoints
We provid pretrained checkpoints of BiomedGPT (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cu2r5zkj2r0e6zu/AADZ-KHn-emsICawm9CM4MqVa?dl=0">Dropbox</a>), which can be put in the `scripts/` folder for further development. For finetuned checkpoints, please refer to [checkpoints.md](checkpoints.md). 
## Note:
We emphasize that BiomedGPT, including its files, code, and checkpoints, is strictly for academic research purposes. Commercial and clinical uses are strictly prohibited for three key reasons: First, BiomedGPT is based on the OFA framework, which carries a non-commercial license that we have inherited. Second, our model is not licensed for use in healthcare settings. Finally, we have not implemented sufficient security measures, and the current model cannot guarantee the accuracy required for medical diagnoses.

# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/taokz/BiomedGPT
conda env create -f biomedgpt.yml
python -m pip install pip==21.2.4
pip install fairseq
```
<br></br>


# Implementation
We provide the preprocessing, pretraining, finetuning and inference scripts in the `scripts/` folder. You can follow the directory setting below:

```

â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Pretraining
Please follow [datasets.md](datasets.md) to prepare pretraining datasets, which includes 4 TSV files: <code>vision_language.tsv</code>, <code>text.tsv</code>, <code>image.tsv</code> and <code>detection.tsv</code> in the directory of `./datasets/pretraining/`.

<pre>
cd scripts/pretrain
bash pretrain_tiny.sh
</pre>
Feel free to modify the hyperparameters in the bash script for your requirements or ablation study.
